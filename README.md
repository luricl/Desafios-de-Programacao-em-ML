# Machine Learning Programming Challenges

The content of each notebook is as follows:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3A. Multiclass Classification
3B. Backpropagation on Multiclass Classification problems
4. Deep Neural Networks
5. Convolutional Neural Networks
6. Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
7. Autoencoders

The last notebook is the final project, where the Autoencoder is enhanced.
